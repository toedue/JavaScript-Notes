## Concatenation

### What It Is
- What it does: Concatenation means joining strings (or other stuff) using the `+` operator. Like gluing words to form a sentence!
- When to use it: Anytime you wanna combine text, like names or messages. Just add a space if needed to keep it readable.

#### Example:
```javascript
/*
  Concatenation Example
  - Using + to join two strings with a space.
*/

let a = "We Love"
let b = "JavaScript"

document.write(a + " " + b) // Writes "We Love JavaScript" to the page
```

### Bonus: Console Logging Multiple Args
- What it does: When you `console.log()` multiple things separated by commas, it prints them all out with spaces in between—no need for `+`!
- Why it’s handy: Cleaner than concatenation for quick logs, and it handles different types too.

#### Example:
```javascript
/*
  Console Log Multiple Args
  - Logging two variables with a comma.
*/

console.log(a, b) // Prints "We Love JavaScript" in the console
```
