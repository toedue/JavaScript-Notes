# JavaScript Comments

## 1. Single-line Comment

* Use `//` for comments that fit in **one line**.
* Ignored by JavaScript.

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment
let x = 5; // Comment after a line of code
console.log(x);
// Output: 5
```

## 2. Multi-line Comment

* Use `/* ... */` for **longer explanations** or **commenting multiple lines**.

```javascript
/*
  This is a multi-line comment
  It can span multiple lines
  Useful for explaining code in detail
*/
```
